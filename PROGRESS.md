## Technical Architecture

The app uses a provider-based architecture for handling multiple social platforms:

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ post/PostProviders.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ storage/StorageProviders.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ PostProvider.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PostContext.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ instagram/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tiktok/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ twitter/
â””â”€â”€ instructions/page.tsx (our current focus)
```

The instructions page serves as the comprehensive onboarding experience for users setting up their self-hosted instance of TheToolkit.
